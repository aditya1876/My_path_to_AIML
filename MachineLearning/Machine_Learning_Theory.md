#Machine Learning
##LifeCycle
1. Collecting Data
2. Data Wrapping - convert raw data into usable format.
3. Analyse Data - understand the data and select a suitable model
4. Train Algorithm - train the model
5. Test Algorithm - Check the accuracy of the model
6. Deployment - operation and Optimization

##Types of ML
1. Supervised Learning - provide input and output to model for it to learn
    1. Linear regression
    2. Logistic Regression
    3. Decision Tree
    4. Random forest
    5. Naive Bayes Classifier
2. Reinforcement Learning - Agent learning based on the responses
3. Unsupervised Learning - model automatically clusters the input data into classes. 
    1. Exclusive clustering
    2. Overlapping clustering
    3. Hierarchical clustering
