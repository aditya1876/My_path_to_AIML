#Overview
##Qualitative data
1. Nominal Data - data with no order
2. Ordinal data - Ordered data
3. Binary data - data with only 2 options(yes/no, male/female)

##Quantitative data
1. Discreet data - data with descreet values. Those that cannot be subdevided meaningfully(counts)
2. Continuus data - data that has contious value (kg can be devided into mg)

##Population vs sampling
1. population - entire pool of data
2. sample - subset of population that can be used as an set that represnts the population.
    1. Porbability - each individual has a knon non-zero probility of being selected in the sample.
        1. Random sampling - each individual has equal chance of selection
        2. Systamatic sampling (nth name selection) - every 'n' th individual is selected after determining n. 
        3. stratified sampling - based on a few pre-defined stratas froMm which different groups within the pupulaiton are chosen
    2. non probability sampling - non random sampling.
        1. Convenient sampling
        2. quota sampling
        3. Judgement sampling
3. Sampling error - error % by which a sample might differ from the population.

##Measure of Center 
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode

##Measure of Spread
1. Range
2. Inter-quartile range
3. Variance - 
4. Standard Deviation

##Skewness - measure of symmetry/ or lack of symmetry

##Probability
1. Probability Density Function - equation describing the continuous probabilty distribution
2. Normal Distribution - 
3. Central Limit Theorem
